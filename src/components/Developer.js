// Add a Developer component which displays a single developer (say, their name and email address).
//Loop over the developers and use this new component to display each one of them. console.log(this.props.dev) first to check what you are getting as props from the store.

// import developerlist
// console log list to see data. (console.log(this.props.dev))
// map the developerlist over a <ul><li>, render.
// import Developer in app.js
